# Questions

**Question 1**

*(Discuss the differences among the results. Does the starting point make a difference?)*

- Yes, starting from a different country drastically changes the order of the search (with the exception of RandomWalk).

**Question 2**

*(Give two or three examples of how/why a real-world map might require more than four colors)*

- One reason could be with enclaves/exclaves or any other form of foreign territory (but not mainland) surrounded by another country.
- Another example is if the oceans and lakes recieve their own color, requiring a fifth one.
